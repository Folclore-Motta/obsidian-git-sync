When we create notes we are externalizing our thoughts

linking them we create a network of inter connected knowledge which we can access the previous concepts that we have externalized with the new ones. Making our notes have more and more value of over time and more rich contents allowing us to grow and cultivate them. Let's imagine that we have discover one interesting thing about  a previous subject that we have early discovered

In resume:

Your notes have more concepts and content because of linking

Your notes doesn't lost value over time, conversely it grows over time because we can cultivate the concepts and add more content or update the information.

We can map having more control of our notes resulting in a more organized environment. 

We can recall to these ideas because we can go backwards into the links and refresh the idea in your mind.
