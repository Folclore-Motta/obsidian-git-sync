## Definition
Pyenv is a tool to isolate the versions of python and that you have by default most of OS come with a pre installed version in UNIX systems you can check by `which python` that will return the path for the binary usually located at  `/usr/bin/python` which means that it will be available through the whole system and int the most of the cases it will not be the lasted version to make sure that system won't break.

## Application

Now imagine that we want to install a different version of the python that aren't the default that comes with the system. It will not be possible because you may break the system (Need to insert a further explanation) and not only for the python versions but for the package and libraries as well.

## PIP
The [[PIP]] is a package manager for leading with libraries in python and in most of the cases you might be aware that you can't have two package managers in your system which may cause several problems with versions and etc... (Need to insert further explanation).

And the PIP need [[Sudo]] permission to install a package because it install through the whole system `sudo pip install [package]` 

## Why not use the system package manager
