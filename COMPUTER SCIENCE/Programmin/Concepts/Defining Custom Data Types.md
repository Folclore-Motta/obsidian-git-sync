The C keyword `typedef` provides a way to create a shorthand or rewritten name for data types.

The basic idea is to first define a type in the normal way, then alias it to something else.

```C
typedef unsigned char byte;
typedef char * string;
```

One of the cases the most use Data Types are in [[Structs]] to make them more clear to read.
