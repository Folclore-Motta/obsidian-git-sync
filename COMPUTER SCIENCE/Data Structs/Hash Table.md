Hash table is a very important Data Structure Widely used

Let's imagine that we have an array of 11 elements


0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10

To calculate the value of a data we have multiple ways In this case let's use an string as example with the string: "Mia".

First we sum all of the letters by it's ANSCI code;
Mia M 77 i 107 a 97 = 279 

Therefore we divide the result by quantity of elements in the array in that case there are 11
279 / 11 = 

Consider one dimensional array of values
