# Definition
SQL is a programming language that stands for __"Structured Query Language"__ and follows the relacional schema which means that the tables can relate to each other in various ways and grows vertically.


You can use SQL to get the RDBMS some tasks:
- Create, retrieve, update and delete data.
- Create and manage databases.
- Design and create databases tables.
- Perform administration tasks (security, user management, import/export, etc).

SQL implementations vary between systems
- Not all RDBMS' follow the SQL standard to a 'T'
- The concepts are the same but the implementation may vary

SQL is actually a hybrid language, it's basically 3 types of languages in one
1. Data Query Language(DQL)
	- Use to query the database information.
	- Get information that is already stored there.
1. Data Definition Language(DDL)
	- Used for defining databases schema.
1. Data Control Language(DCL)
	- Used for controlling access to the data in the database.
	- User and permissions management
1. Data Manipulation Language(DML)
	- Used for inserting, updating and deleting data from the database

# Queries
- A query is a set of instructions given to the RDBMS (Written is SQL) that tell the RDBMS what information you want it to retrieve for you.
- It's basically an order to the RDBMS to give you the information that you want through a SQL code.

# Table and Keys

SQL is organized through tables that contains rows and columns and one of those columns have to be a **Primary Key** that is a key that owns a unique value making possible to differentiate rows with the same values.
**Primary Key** could be every type of data like and ID which is a _numeric data_ or could be an E-mail which is a _text data_, the only requirement to be determine a possible value for a **primary key** is that must be **unique**.


NoSQL and SQL

Foreign Key

Primary Key

Constraints

Primitive 

Composite key
Is a key that's basically made out of two columns 

Structured Query Language (SQL)
SQL is a language used for interacting with Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
